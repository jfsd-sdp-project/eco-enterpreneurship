#ECO-ENTERPRENEURSHIP


This repository is about the skill development project that we have worked on as a part of our academics.

The objective of our project is to support startups in enhancing their environmental initiatives to foster green entrepreneurship in India. We aim to develop a Java full-stack application that will facilitate the creation of eco-friendly projects by providing suggestions and assessing their environmental impact. Users will be able to contribute ideas, view existing sustainable projects, and even donate to social causes. This application will not only offer valuable insights for aspiring eco-entrepreneurs but also promote a culture of sustainability. Key advantages include improved brand image, increased competitive advantage, enhanced productivity, and better financial opportunities. The project comprises several modules, including user management, idea generation, project viewing, donation functionalities, and project updates. Technologies utilized in the development include Eclipse, MySQL, Spring Boot, and AWS Cloud.
